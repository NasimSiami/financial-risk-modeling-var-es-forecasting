# Financial Risk Modeling and Forecast Evaluation

This two-part project explores financial risk modeling and simulation using Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and forecast evaluation methods. Developed for MATH 60210 at HEC MontrÃ©al, the notebooks apply advanced Python techniques to model, simulate, and evaluate market risk.
